# What is Challenge League?
Challenge League: Ticket to the Universe is an event run on [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org) in where you have a whole month to complete 9 "Choose Your Own Adventure" style game boards. Every month, a new board releases with a new theme to it. For example, Board 1 requires playing games within certain genres, whereas Board 2 requires playing games with protagonists within certain categories.
